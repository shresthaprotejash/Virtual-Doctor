The main aim of the project in hand is to provide an improved, 
faster and instant approach of diagnosing and prescribing 
medicines to different diseases.It is a substitute to the 
local primary healthcare system.It acts as a charity at the 
intersection of technology and medicine.Provides a faster way 
to detect health problems to localities of remote areas.It 
provides better healthcare at your fingertips.Acts as a 
medical consultant at your doorstep.The software developed 
at the end of this project detects the disease affected to the 
user based on the symptoms given as the input by the patient. 
The software also prescribes medicines and gives precautions to 
treat the disease.The code is a prototype of an actual virtual 
doctor software,which can be built by including more number 
of diseases.
