# Virtual-Doctor
This is a C based graphical user interface program which helps you to find the disease from the symptoms. The tabs helps to switch between the categories.
First category is about the program.
Second category is getting the information about the disease like sypmtoms, preventions, medicine prescribed after you enter the disease name.
Third category is about finding the disease through symptoms, if the sypmtops matches more then 60 percent with a particular disease, it suggests the user with the infected disease.
Fourth category is to get the medicine of the disease, if you know the disease before.
Fifth category is about the programmers and a way to exit.

The dropdown option in the application makes user more relaible and easy to use. The database is limited for now but it can be increased with the time.
Its a project of my C on my 2nd year of engineering.
